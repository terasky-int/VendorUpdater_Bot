* Email Notification System
* Microsoft Email Support
* Graph Database Relationship Validation
	Implement the Enhanced Relationship Validation
	Create the graph_db_enhanced.py module as described in the documentation
	Add confidence levels to vendor-product relationships
	Implement the validation tool
* test the api endpoint of the app.
* test docker deployment.
* Error Handling in Unified Search
* Configuration Management
* Documentation Gaps
* Optimize Folder Structure
	Move graph_api.py and graph_db.py into a dedicated graph/ directory
	Move rag_api.py into a dedicated api/ directory
	Consolidate test data in a more organized structure
* Clean Up Unused Files
	The misc/Design/ folder contains planning documents that could be moved to docs/
	Some test emails in misc/tst_emls/ might be redundant	
* Create Comprehensive Documentation
	Add setup guides for all components
	Create user guides for different use cases
	Document API endpoints and parameters
* search functionality improvements:
	Fuzzy Matching: Implement fuzzy text matching for product and vendor names to handle typos and variations.
	Query Expansion: Add synonyms for common terms to improve recall (e.g., "security" â†’ "vulnerability", "protection").
	Relevance Tuning: Adjust the weighting between vector similarity and graph importance scores to optimize result ranking.
	Caching Search Results: Cache frequent search queries with short TTL (30-60 seconds) to improve response time for repeated queries.
	Pagination Support: Add offset/limit parameters to support paginated results for large result sets.
	Faceted Search: Return facets (counts by vendor, product, type) to help users refine their searches.
	Hybrid Filtering: Use a combination of exact and partial matching based on field type (exact for vendors, partial for content).
	Semantic Chunking: Improve document chunking to create more semantically meaningful segments for better retrieval.
	Query Understanding: Add a preprocessing step to better extract search intent from natural language queries.
	Performance Metrics: Add instrumentation to track search latency and result quality for continuous improvement.

* additional Tests Needed
Confidence Level Validation
Test that relationship confidence levels are correctly assigned
Verify that high/medium/low confidence relationships are properly distinguished
Graph-Enhanced Ranking
Test that search results are properly re-ranked based on graph relationships
Compare ranking with and without graph enhancement
Fallback Mechanism
Test the fallback to graph search when vector search returns no results
Verify that the system gracefully handles empty results
Error Handling
Test with malformed queries
Test with non-existent vendors/products
Test with empty database
Performance Testing
Measure search response time with different query complexities
Test with larger datasets to ensure scalability
