* Email Notification System
* Microsoft Email Support
* Graph Database Relationship Validation
	Implement the Enhanced Relationship Validation
	Create the graph_db_enhanced.py module as described in the documentation
	Add confidence levels to vendor-product relationships
	Implement the validation tool
* test the api endpoint of the app.
* test docker deployment.
* Error Handling in Unified Search
* Configuration Management
* Documentation Gaps
* Optimize Folder Structure
	Move graph_api.py and graph_db.py into a dedicated graph/ directory
	Move rag_api.py into a dedicated api/ directory
	Consolidate test data in a more organized structure
* Clean Up Unused Files
	The misc/Design/ folder contains planning documents that could be moved to docs/
	Some test emails in misc/tst_emls/ might be redundant	
* Create Comprehensive Documentation
	Add setup guides for all components
	Create user guides for different use cases
	Document API endpoints and parameters




	Additional Tests Needed
Confidence Level Validation
Test that relationship confidence levels are correctly assigned
Verify that high/medium/low confidence relationships are properly distinguished
Graph-Enhanced Ranking
Test that search results are properly re-ranked based on graph relationships
Compare ranking with and without graph enhancement
Fallback Mechanism
Test the fallback to graph search when vector search returns no results
Verify that the system gracefully handles empty results
Error Handling
Test with malformed queries
Test with non-existent vendors/products
Test with empty database
Performance Testing
Measure search response time with different query complexities
Test with larger datasets to ensure scalability
