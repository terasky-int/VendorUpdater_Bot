# VendorUpdater Bot — Full Context Dump

## ✅ Current Status
You’re testing the full data ingestion pipeline for `VendorUpdater_Bot`, including:
- Email harvesting and cleaning
- Metadata enrichment and vendor inference
- Classification using Claude 3 on Bedrock
- Chunking and Titan embeddings
- Indexing into ChromaDB
- Vector search CLI with filters

## 🔍 Current Fixes Applied
- `llm_utils.py`: Centralized config, Titan embeddings, and Chroma collection loader
- `main.py`: Uses `llm_utils.get_chroma_collection()` instead of instantiating `PersistentClient` directly
- `classify.py`: Refactored classification response handling to parse Claude’s verbose replies robustly
- `enrich.py`: Improved `infer_vendor` to use public suffix logic (`tldextract`) and made `extract_metadata()` testable
- `indexer.py`: Tested indexing with fake vectors
- Full pipeline verified working end-to-end
- Tested with real and synthetic emails

## 🧪 Test Notes
- Deleted and recreated ChromaDB to reset state
- Used CLI to verify presence and metadata accuracy of embedded docs
- Encountered Claude formatting bug → fixed by regex and `repr()` debug logging

## 🛠️ Next Steps (Your Plan)
- Improve document relevance in Chroma (possibly using hybrid ranking)
- Begin “test RAG” flow or answer generation test
- Add `evaluate.py` with sample RAG prompt and validation harness
