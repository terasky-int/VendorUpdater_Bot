1. Harvest:
What are your data sources?
Emails

source is semi-structured, email is structured, the data might include msg body, and various doc attachmants like docs,pps,xls,pdf..

Do you need change detection or incremental harvesting?
will run every X hours and get all unread emails.

2. Normalize:
What formats need conversion or cleanup?
email content with various attachments mostly word,xls,pdf,clear text,ppt in mostly english but need to suppot hebrew too

Is document segmentation important?
the emails are all incomming vendor emails that might contain:
updates, invites, new releases, events, sale promotions, and other similar, not sure what segmentation will be most valuable in this case.

Do you need to resolve references or links?
dont think so, at this stage. might be required on later iterations of the app.

3. Enrich:
What metadata is necessary for retrieval or filtering?
email metadata:
sender,
date recieved,
email subject,
expiration (relevant to the email content like a special limited deal, or event, etc)
topic,
vendor (might be extracted from senders email domain)
product (discussed in the email),
i would like for the ai-agent that will condume this, have an optimized way to reference only a specific vendor,product,type emails,
any other ideas for classification?

Do you need any NLP enrichments?
yes
Named Entity Recognition? Topic modeling?

Is language detection or translation needed?
Are you supporting multilingual documents?
should support english -primary and hebrew -secondary

4. Embed:
What‚Äôs your chunking strategy?
Fixed tokens? Semantic breaks? Sliding windows?
dont know - need leading questions to define

Which embedding model(s) will you use?
dont know - need leading questions to define
i do have access to aws bedrock models, and if there is a uniqe value of using local models, that also might be an option, but if local model is chosen,should be light weight and not requiring gpu

Are you preserving chunk-to-document mapping?
Do you store full document context along with the chunk?
dont know - need leading questions to define

5. Index:
Which database fits your search needs?
ChromaDB

Do you need hybrid search?
Vector + keyword or metadata filters?
i think so, validating the semantic search with metadata can be more accurate.

Will you handle versioning or re-indexing?
How do you update or invalidate old entries?
dont know - need leading questions to define

6. Optimize for LLMs:
How will you test retrieval relevance?
dont know - need leading questions or suggestions to define

Golden set of questions? Manual review? RAG eval tools?
Will you apply re-ranking or summarization post-retrieval?
e.g., use an LLM to sort results by answer likelihood?
Are you optimizing prompts based on data structure?
e.g., custom system prompts based on chunk source?
dont know - need leading questions or suggestions to define

7. Other Considerations:
Security: Are there sensitive documents? Need encryption or access control?
not at this stage.

Monitoring: Do you need alerts for harvest failures, low embedding quality, or index corruption?
not at this stage

Scalability: How much data? Will it grow over time? Need batch processing or streaming?
dont know - need leading questions or suggestions to define
preferably should work as a container









ANSWER:
Refined Pipeline Flow
Based on your input, the revised flow becomes:

Harvest ‚Üí Normalize ‚Üí Enrich ‚Üí Classify ‚Üí Chunk ‚Üí Embed ‚Üí Index ‚Üí Optimize for LLM

üì® 1. Harvest (Emails)
Your Setup:
Source: IMAP (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
Criteria: Pull all unread emails with attachments
Schedule: Cron-based (X hours)
Tag processed emails (e.g., move to a "digested" folder or mark as read)

Extract:
Email metadata
Plain text from body (strip signatures/HTML)
Attachments (convert to text)


üßπ 2. Normalize
Formats:
DOCX, XLS(X), PDF, PPT, HTML/MSG ‚Üí Clean Text
Languages: English + Hebrew (ensure UTF-8 support)
Recommendations:
Use libraries:
textract or unstructured for parsing diverse formats
langdetect for detecting language (ensure fallback)

Normalize structure:
Remove headers/footers
Flatten tables/slides into sentence-like blocks

Follow-up:
‚§¥Ô∏è Would you like to segment based on:
Paragraphs per topic? - not sure
Time-based (e.g., email body first vs attachment)? - not sure
Entity mentions (e.g., each section that talks about a product/vendor)? - definatly key identifires (vendor, product, type of content)

üß† 3. Enrich
Your Plan:
Extract:
date and time,Sender, subject, vendor, product, content classification(might require llm for content classify)
Expiration date (if exists) (i think that it needs an llm to determin)
Topic type (e.g., promotion, invite, release, update, valnerability, patch, etc.)

Suggestions:
NER:
what is ner?
use Bedrock Claude/LLM for vendor/product extraction if not found in text or sender email domain

Classification:
Train a simple classifier for:
type = ["event", "release", "promo", "news", "support", "valnerability", "patch"]

Additional Ideas:
Detect urgency (e.g., "last chance", "limited offer") - nice but optional
Detect dates related to events (for filtering expired info) - yes

üß© 4. Chunking & Embedding
Chunking ‚Äî You‚Äôre unsure. Here's how to choose:
üìå Key Questions:
Do attachments or email bodies contain multi-topic sections?
not sure.

Do you want the LLM to retrieve a full concept, even if long?
not sure.

Recommendations:
Start with:
Fixed-size token chunks (e.g., 512‚Äì750 tokens) with 20% overlap
sounds good

Refine to:
Semantic chunking using LangChain‚Äôs text splitter or unstructured

Embedding ‚Äî You‚Äôre unsure. Here's how to choose:
üìå Key Questions:
Is AWS Bedrock sufficient in your case?
you tell me.

Prefer local? dont have a preferance, what are the pros/cons ?

Recommendations:
Start with:
Titan Embeddings (fully managed, scalable)
Keep fallback to:
bge-small locally via sentence-transformers if needed
sounds good
Preserve document ‚Üî chunk mapping for traceability.

üìá 5. Index
Your Plan:
Use ChromaDB

Suggestions:
Yes to hybrid search:
Store: embedding + full text + metadata
Allow: keyword filter on vendor, product, type, date_range
Leading Questions:
Will documents expire? (e.g., event passed, sale expired)
probably in some cases. so lets consider periodically re-harvest and update index

How to re-index?
Keep an index manifest (JSON) per run with hashes ‚Üí detect content changes for update/delete logic.

üß™ 6. LLM Optimization

Retrieval Relevance Testing
üìå Questions:
Can you create a set of test queries?
e.g., "Show all Dell product releases from May"
i can work on some example queries that might be highly relevant or popular.

Do you expect the LLM to retrieve only one answer, or a set of summaries?
might be a set, i might consider multiple iterations - with one answer at a time.

Techniques:
Manual: Review retrieval output vs expected
Automated: Use LangChain's RAG evaluator or ask the LLM to self-grade answers
not sure- please advise

Prompt Optimization:
Include source metadata in the context (e.g., ‚ÄúDell ‚Äì Release ‚Äì 2024-05-01‚Äù)

Tailor system prompt:
‚ÄúYou are a knowledge assistant helping summarize vendor email updates. Focus on vendor, product, and type.‚Äù

üöÄ 7. Scalability & Execution
You mentioned:
Containerized
Run via cron

‚úÖ Excellent. Add:
--dry-run mode for testing

Logging JSON files for post-run QA
Optional Slack/email alert (e.g., 0 results, embedding failure)
might be a good option - for a later phase, i can work with a local txt log file at this stage

Key Next Steps:
Decide:
Titan embeddings or local model
lets start with tiatn unless not sugested by you
Chunking strategy (start fixed, plan for semantic)

Define:
Metadata fields per document
Classification labels and NER targets

Prototype:
Single email + attachment run-through
Save intermediate steps (text, metadata, chunk, vector)

Would you like me to generate a working folder structure, Python module blueprint, and starter scripts (cron-ready + Dockerized)?
lets keep working on the definitions and boundaries for this app, please ask more relevant questions to focus even more.

Perfect ‚Äî your responses help solidify the foundation. Before jumping into implementation, let‚Äôs now zoom in further on 4 critical areas to finalize the core design:

üîç Section 1: NER (Named Entity Recognition) and Classification
ü§ñ Tools:
SpaCy (fast, local)
Bedrock LLM (Claude or Titan Text models) ‚Äì better for fuzzy, informal content
Option: run NER ‚Üí classify ‚Üí extract in one Bedrock prompt
sounds good, i dont really understand the meaning, please advise.

‚úÖ Follow-up Question:
Do you want NER as a standalone step, or combined with classification inside an LLM prompt?
what would be more effectice and accurate ?

Do you want to build a small dataset for fine-tuning a classifier later (optional)?
i dont really understand the meaning, please advise.

üß† Section 2: Classification Labels (and Future Expandability)
You've listed:
type = ["event", "release", "promo", "news", "support", "vulnerability", "patch"]
üîç Suggestions to Expand/Refine:
Add: "product update", "webinar", "whitepaper", "announcement", "maintenance"
sure, i like it.

Group into buckets:
marketing: ["promo", "event", "webinar", "announcement"]
security: ["vulnerability", "patch", "maintenance"]
technical: ["support", "product update", "whitepaper"]
- perfect

üß© Follow-up Question:
Would you like to maintain these labels in a config file so you can easily update them without changing the code?
yes, also add the email address and password to the config, and i can also add a list of products, but this will not be complete
Do you want multi-label classification? (e.g., "promo" + "product update")
if it adds significant value, sure.

ü™ú Section 3: Embedding Model Choice - Titan vs Local
You're starting with Titan ‚Äì good default.

üß© Follow-up Question:
Do you want to benchmark Titan vs local on your real data later for accuracy/cost tradeoffs?
no, lets start with titan for simplicity.

Will you need to encrypt embeddings or anonymize data before sending to Titan?
no

üß† Section 4: Indexing & Re-indexing Logic
You liked the idea of using a manifest (JSON) with hashes.

üîç We can define a plan:
{
  "email_id": "<msg_id>",
  "hash": "<content_sha256>",
  "vendor": "dell.com",
  "type": "patch",
  "status": "indexed",
  "indexed_at": "2025-05-21T12:00:00"
}

üß© Follow-up Questions:
What is the granularity of indexing?
Per email?
Per attachment?
Per chunk?
not sure what is the tradeoff, please suggest

Do you want to maintain:
A central manifest (e.g., one file for all indexed emails)
central

üî¨ Section 5: LLM Optimization Strategy
You‚Äôre open to:
Manual review - at the initial steps to better debug.
LangChain‚Äôs RAG evaluator - sure, dont know what it is :)
LLM-based self-evaluation - sure, dont know what it is :)

üìå Questions:
How often do you plan to evaluate retrieval quality?
After every change?
Weekly/monthly?
Only on user feedback?
for each new email that is being fetched. i think.. not sure

Would you like the app to have a ‚Äúdebug mode‚Äù to:
verbose text file log.
Print top-k chunks retrieved for a query - if it might help you debug.
Print the final answer from LLM - sure
Print a similarity confidence score? - yes

üì¶ Bonus: Intermediate Artifacts
Your pipeline could optionally persist intermediate steps like:
raw_email.txt
clean_text.json
metadata.json
chunks.json
embeddings.npy
index.log
what does it mean ?

üß© Final Question for Now:
Do you want these intermediate artifacts to be:
Always saved (for transparency/debugging)?
Only saved in debug/dry-run mode?
Discarded after indexing?
always saved for the debuging phase, laster on for production please suggest.

This is excellent progress ‚Äî your answers make it clear you're designing this system with both short-term experimentation and long-term maintainability in mind. Let's finalize the core design choices, explain the open concepts, and suggest best practices where you're unsure.

üîç Section 1: NER & Classification
‚úÖ Clarification: What is NER and Why Use It?
NER (Named Entity Recognition) is the process of extracting specific data points from unstructured text, like:
Text Example	Entities Detected
"Dell is releasing PowerMax on June 5"	vendor: Dell, product: PowerMax, date: June 5
Usefulness:
Structure chaotic data (e.g., emails, attachments)
Extract structured metadata for indexing and search
good

üîÅ LLM Prompt vs. Standalone NER
Option	Pros	Cons
Standalone NER (e.g., SpaCy)	Fast, free, deterministic	Less accurate for ambiguous or novel inputs
LLM Prompt (e.g., Claude on Bedrock)	High accuracy, context-aware	Higher cost, slower, requires structured prompting
‚úÖ Recommendation:
Combine them:
Use heuristics + SpaCy to extract obvious stuff
Fall back to Claude prompt when confidence is low or missing data
sure - i accept

üìå Clarification: Fine-Tuning a Classifier
This means creating your own model trained on labeled examples of your data (emails labeled with types, products, etc.). You don‚Äôt need this now, since:
You can start with LLM-based classification
It adds engineering overhead and requires labeled data
‚úÖ Skip fine-tuning for now.
sure - i accept

üß† Section 2: Classification & Configs
You're clear: ‚úÖ
Use config file for classification labels
Add product list (even if incomplete)
Add email credentials (securely, e.g., .env or mounted secrets in container)
Allow multi-label classification
‚úÖ We'll design config.yaml to handle this flexibly.

üß© Section 3: Embedding Model
You're going with Titan ‚Äì good for managed scalability. ‚úÖ No encryption needed, no local fallback for now.

üóÉÔ∏è Section 4: Indexing Strategy
üìå Clarification: Indexing Granularity
Chunk-level	Best for LLM retrieval	More metadata & mapping	‚úÖ Best option
sure - i accept

‚úÖ Recommendation:
Index per chunk, but retain mapping to email & attachment
Include metadata like:
Email subject, sender, vendor, attachment name
Chunk position within the document
‚úÖ Store manifest centrally as a single JSON file (e.g., manifest.jsonl)
sure - i accept

üß™ Section 5: LLM Optimization
üìå Clarification:
LangChain RAG Evaluator: Measures how well retrieved chunks help answer a question
LLM Self-Evaluation: Ask the model: ‚ÄúOn a scale of 1‚Äì5, how relevant was the input context to answering the question?‚Äù

‚úÖ Recommendation:
Enable debug mode to output:
Top-K retrieved chunks
Final answer
Confidence score (e.g., cosine similarity)
Evaluate for each new email ‚Üí Ideal during development
Switch to batch eval (daily/weekly) in production for performance
sure - i accept

üì¶ Bonus: Intermediate Artifacts
üìå Clarification:
These are files saved at each step of processing. For example:
File	Description
raw_email.txt	Full email body
clean_text.json	Parsed email + attachments as clean text
metadata.json	Enriched metadata (vendor, type, etc.)
chunks.json	Tokenized chunks with IDs
embeddings.npy	Vector representations of chunks
index.log	Log of what was indexed, when, and how

‚úÖ Recommendation:
Development: Save everything by default
sure - i accept

Production:
Save metadata, chunks, and index.log
Discard large files like embeddings.npy if not needed for audit
Use a --debug or --save-artifacts flag in CLI
sure - i accept

‚úÖ Summary of Design Decisions
Component	Choice
NER & Classification	Combo: Heuristics ‚Üí Claude fallback
Classifier Labels	Stored in config.yaml, multi-label enabled
Embedding Model	AWS Titan (start simple)
Indexing Granularity	Per chunk with full mapping
Evaluation	Per-email debug during dev; batch optional later
Artifacts	Save all during debug; flag-controlled in prod

Would you like me to now generate:
config.yaml template
yes

manifest.json structure
yes

Folder/module structure and starter Python files (Dockerized & cron-ready)
yes

also, a flowchat to visualize the project flow and steps.
