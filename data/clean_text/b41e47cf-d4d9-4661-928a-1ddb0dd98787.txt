​Hi Everyone,

​We'll be using this event for periodical TLVCommunity updates to email (due to a Luma limitation with subscriber segmentation, and not wanting to spam non-Israelis).

​RSVP to this event to stay updated about upcoming community activities (like a listserv).

​Our first update is posted, and the event description will serve as our community sticky.

​**Highlights**:

​- CFP for DevOpsDays TLV is open

​- Our Q2 TLVCommunity Summer Blitz is announced, happening on July 1st at groudcover

​- We are relaunching CNCF Jerusalem for our Yerushalmi friends, so be sure to subscribe and join our next event at the end of June hosted by TeraSky and Mobileye.

​CFP for both meetups is open - find all the links in the bulletin board.

​Looking forward to seeing you at our upcoming events. ✌🏽
