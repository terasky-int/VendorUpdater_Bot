Important Update: Delay in Launching Flex Multiyear for Partner Resell

We previously announced a launch of partners reselling Flex Multiyear, with a new partner incentive program. Originally we had targeted a May launch, however, we regret to inform you that there has been a delay in launching this program.

We take the stability of your business with HashiCorp very seriously. Introducing a program at the time of a larger adjustment into IBM Partner Plus Program, is not the stability we seek to have with our valued business partners. We are working diligently to deliver Flex Multiyear as a resell motion under the IBM Partner Plus Program.

What this means for you:

IBM Partner Plus Program: We encourage you to register for the IBM Partner Plus Program<https://view.hashicorp.com/ODQ1LVpMRi0xOTEAAAGaMPfYoxCqgFQslt_doCj3VPlw8FXoILnEBdllYkcvWq6q3_ykqXJwMCz6BEO5PeZCpztxXFM=>, where you can currently transact HCP entitlements. This will ensure you can still serve your clients needs today!
Partners Reselling Flex Multiyear: We are working closely with our IBM team to build Flex product parts under the IBM umbrella and are aligning the incentive program through the larger Partner Plus Program.
Current Transactions: Until the Flex Multiyear is available as an IBM part, partners will not be able to transact Flex Multiyear deals, nor will any incentives be awarded under this model. Please continue with the standard process for non Flex Multiyear transactions until further details are provided.

We apologize for any inconvenience this delay may have caused and appreciate your understanding. Stay tuned for further updates, and thank you for your continued partnership.
