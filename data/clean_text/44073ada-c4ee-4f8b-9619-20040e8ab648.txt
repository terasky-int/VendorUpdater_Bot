‚ÄãHi Everyone,

‚ÄãWe'll be using this event for periodical TLVCommunity updates to email (due to a Luma limitation with subscriber segmentation, and not wanting to spam non-Israelis).

‚ÄãRSVP to this event to stay updated about upcoming community activities (like a listserv).

‚ÄãOur first update is posted, and the event description will serve as our community sticky.

‚Äã**Highlights**:

‚Äã- CFP for DevOpsDays TLV is open

‚Äã- Our Q2 TLVCommunity Summer Blitz is announced, happening on July 1st at groudcover

‚Äã- We are relaunching CNCF Jerusalem for our Yerushalmi friends, so be sure to subscribe and join our next event at the end of June hosted by TeraSky and Mobileye.

‚ÄãCFP for both meetups is open - find all the links in the bulletin board.

‚ÄãLooking forward to seeing you at our upcoming events. ‚úåüèΩ
